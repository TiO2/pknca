# Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org) except where that readily conflicts with existing code.  PKNCA is moving (slowly) toward more tidyverse-like styling.
You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to
apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with 
your PR.
*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html), 
for documentation.  
*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions
with test cases included are easier to accept.  
*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the current
development version header describing the changes made followed by your GitHub
username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
