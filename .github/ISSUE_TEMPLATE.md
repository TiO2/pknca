Please include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.

If you think that you have found a bug or you have a feature request, please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect.

If you have a question, please ask what you're curious about ideally with expected input, output, and what you have tried (a reprex, if feasible).
